# Frontend Starter

Starter template for developing static pages using gulp, sass and nunjucks.
Nunjucks are being used for templating to avoid code repetition.

You can write your HTML normally as you do in _index.njk_ located in _src_ folder.
This file is then being compiled to classic HTML file and moved to dist folder.

SASS files are being compiled into CSS and then moved into _dist/css_ folder - minified and normal version is being outputed.

You can change ouput folder or source folders in gulpfile.js by changing constants.

2. Navigate to repository folder and run **_npm install_**
